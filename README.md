[00:32.47] Look in the mirror
[00:35.79] Who do you see?
[00:43.29] 
[00:45.20] Someone familiar
[00:48.41] But surely, not me
[00:57.41] 
[00:56.72] For he can't be me
[01:05.72] 
[01:00.12] Look how old and cold and tired
[01:02.90] And lonely he's become
[01:09.69] Not until you see
[01:13.26] There's a price tag hanging off of having all that fun
[01:40.26] 
[01:23.66] Uh-oh, looks like
[01:27.14] I'm seeing more of my old man in me
[01:36.41] Oh, no, looks like
[01:40.17] I'm seeing more of my old man in me
[01:57.67] 
[01:49.81] Walk on the outside, holding her hand
[02:08.31] 
[02:02.32] Somewhat familiar, her and her man
[02:19.32] 
[02:14.15] But it just can't be
[02:17.64] Look at all the steps that brought you where you are today
[02:26.61] Not until you see
[02:30.36] As a heart grows stronger, sometimes love is pushed away
[02:58.36] 
[02:41.08] Uh-oh, looks like
[02:44.03] I'm seeing more of my old man in me
[02:53.66] Oh, no, looks like
[02:56.65] I'm seeing more of my old man in me
[03:14.15] 
[03:06.89] Uh-oh, looks like
[03:09.72] I'm seeing more of my old man in me
[03:19.56] Oh, no, looks like
[03:22.77] I'm seeing more of my old man in me
