My old man had a round of soul
He'd hear an old freight train
Then he'd have to go
Said he'd been blessed with a gypsy bone
That's the reason they guessed
He'd been cursed to roam
Came into town back before the war
Didn't even know what it

Was he was looking for
He carried a tattered bag for his violin
It was full of lots of songs
Of places he had been
He talked real easy
Had a smiling way to pass abn^. to you
When his fiddle played

Making people drop their cares and woes
To hum out loud those tunes
That his fiddle howed
Till the people there began to join that sound
And everyone in town was
Laughing, singing, dancing round
Like the fiddlers tune was

All the years that passed
That love would keep them warm
All their lives they'd share
A dream come true
All because she danced while his fiddle tuned
My old man had a round of soul
He'd hear an old freight train
Then he'd have to go
All that I recall said when I was young
No one else could really
Sing those songs he sung
